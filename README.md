# Dennis Pumphrey (dpumphrey4)
## Computer Scientist
### Bachelors of Science in Computer Science | UNLV 2019 - 2022

Hi, I’m Dennis Pumphrey. I graduated from UNLV with a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science. I’m passionate about technology and always keep up with the latest news. I’m particularly interested in new AI, PowerVia and RibbonFet from Intel, the newest updates of Windows and Linux, the updates on .NET, and looking into the Rust language and all the great security benefits that will bring in the future. 

I enjoy creating basic little programs to make my job easier. Recently, I built a couple of tools in WinUI3 and figured out how to use PowerAutomate to help automate my job. See those programs on my GitHub website at https://dpumphrey4.github.io/. 

For physcial activity I enjoy walking around the block or inside a building, as well as golfing. Taking little physical breaks help me concentrate later. While in my free time away from any learning or job related activities, I enjoy playing many games on an Xbox or on PC, games such as Overwatch, Hi-Fi Rush, Halo and any game that looks interesting to me on Gamepass.

Currently I am looking for a more engaging/interesting job that will require me to learn new technologies and become a better computer scientist. If you think that I could have potential at your company please contact me at dpumphrey4@gmail.com or by phone at 702-469-2258.
